The game of sudoku has a few simple rules:
- The grid is 9x9 with a number in each row
- It's split into 9 3x3 grids
- Each row must contain each digit from 1-9 exactly once
- Each column must contain each digit from 1-9 exactly once
- Each 3x3 box must contain each digit from 1-9 exactly once

The board will look something like this:

<div style={{padding: '20px', backgroundColor: 'tomato', color: 'black' }}>
  **Try and change the background color!**
</div>
